# Text-Based-Game
This was one of my first projects in my Computer Science program. I created a text based game that prompts the user to make a move weather is right, or left, up or down, and they will end up in one of the rooms in the game to collect a certain item. The final room is to defeat a "monster," and then they will complete the game.
